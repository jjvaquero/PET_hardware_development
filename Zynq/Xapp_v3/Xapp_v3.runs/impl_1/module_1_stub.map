Updating timing models...
WARNING:Pack:2768 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component switching limit violations have been detected for
   a constrained component. A timing constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the
   Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to evaluate the component switching limit violations in
   more detail. Evaluate the datasheet for alternative configurations for the component that could allow the frequencies requested in the
   constraint. Otherwise, the timing constraint covering this component might need to be modified to satisfy the component switching limits
   specified in the datasheet.
INFO:Timing:3386 - Intersecting Constraints found and resolved.  For more 
   information, see the TSI report.  Please consult the Xilinx Command Line 
   Tools User Guide for information on generating a TSI report.
INFO:Timing:3284 - This timing report was generated using estimated delay 
   information.  For accurate numbers, please refer to the post Place and Route 
   timing report.
Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 1

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
